## This is a repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

All data tidying is done by the run_analysis.R script, it's output is written to a "tidy_data.txt" file in the
directory in which the script is run.

Important: Make sure that the script file is in the same directory as the UCI HAR Dataset directory before running.
